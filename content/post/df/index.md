### **_Tips_**

- Use the `h` option to display disk space usage in human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB)
- Use the `x` option to exclude file systems of a certain type (e.g., tmpfs,devtmpfs)
- Use the `-output` option to customize the output format of the command
- Use the `sort` and `tail` commands to sort and filter the output as needed.

### **_Conclusion_**

In summary, the `df` command is a powerful tool for managing disk space on your Linux system. With the various options available, you can easily view and analyze disk space usage for specific file systems and customize the output format.
Remember to use the available sorting and filtering commands to further manage and analyze the output.
