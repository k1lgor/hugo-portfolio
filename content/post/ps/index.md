### ***Introduction***

The `ps` command is a powerful tool in Linux that allows you to monitor and manage processes on your system. Whether you need to identify a specific process, check the resource usage of a program, or kill a process that's misbehaving, the `ps` command has you covered.

### ***Using the `ps` Command***

At its simplest, the `ps` command allows you to view information about the processes running on your system. For example, you can use the `ps` command with no options to display a list of all the processes running on your system:

```bash
ps

```

The above command will display a list of all the processes currently running on your system. By default, the `ps` command will display the process ID (PID), the terminal associated with the process, the CPU usage, and the command that started the process

### ***Options and Customization***

While the basic ps command is useful, there are many options and customization features that you can use to tailor the output to your specific needs. For example, you can use the -e option to display information about all processes on the system, regardless of who owns them:

```bash
ps -e
```

Another useful option is the -f option, which displays a more detailed output that includes the UID, PPID, C, STIME, TTY, and TIME fields:

```bash
ps -f
```

### ***Tips and Tricks***

- You can use the `grep` command to search for specific processes. For example, to search for all processes containing the word "chrome", you can use the following command:

```bash
ps -ef | grep brave

```

- You can use the `kill` command to terminate a process. For example, to kill a process with a specific PID, you can use the following command:

```bash
kill PID
```

And you choose the PID number.

- Show all processes with full information:

```bash
ps -ef
```

```bash
ps -ejH
```

```

ps -eo user,pid,ppid,c,start_time,cmd
```

- Show all processes with full information and display the threads for each process:

```bash
ps -eLf
```

- Show all processes with full information and display the start time and elapsed time for each process:

```bash
ps -eo pid,comm,lstart,etime
```

- Show all processes with full information and sort by memory usage (descending):

```bash
ps -e --sort=-rss
```

- Show all processes with full information and display only the processes owned by a specific user:

```bash
ps -u username
```

ps -C program_name
```

- Show all processes with full information and display only the processes with a specific PID:

```bash
ps -p PID
```

- You can use the `top` command to view a dynamic real-time display of the processes running on your system.
